diy-diagram-it-yourself
=======================

DIY - Diagram It Yourselft is a markdown language to describe easily the schemes in your code documentation to illustrate interaction, dependance, etc, on wiki pages or just to share diagrams with others people without specific software 

## Philosophy

+ GUI sucks : I want to edit my diagram from my text editor
+ Less is more : I do not want to write a book for simply diagrams
+ It's Beautiful : I want a beautiful theme by default. Tired of ugly diagrams
+ It's Ugly : AAAH, the default theme sucks, let me to make it myself
+ Code sucks : Bah, code sucks, give me a GUI
+ Cross-platform : I'm sick of files that you can't edit without installing a gas-factory
