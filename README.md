diy-diagram-it-yourself
=======================

DIY - Diagram It Yourselft is a markdown language for describing easily the schemes in your code documentation to illustrate interaction, dependance, etc, on wiki pages or just to share diagrams with others people without specific software

This tools is under development. Specific markdown language are not defined yet. Currently, we use JSON to
describe diagram

## Philosophy

+ GUI sucks : I want to edit my diagram from my text editor
+ Less is more : I do not want to write a book for simple diagrams
+ It's Beautiful : I want a beautiful theme by default. Tired of ugly diagrams
+ It's Ugly : AAAH, the default theme sucks, let me make it myself
+ Code sucks : Bah, code sucks, give me a GUI
+ Cross-platform : I'm sick of files that you can't edit without installing a gas-factory

# Todo

* Rewrite code documentation using real convention
* Rewrite Unit-test
* Vertical and horizontal alignement must be defined in json lib
* Optimize method Interpretor.evalCalculatedStatements

* Define grid for element: Twitter Bootstrap inspiration -> Done
* Think of code organization: Done but can be improve
* Add elements
** Social elements (github, facebook, twitter)
** Infrastructure elements (server, database)
* Add links between elements
