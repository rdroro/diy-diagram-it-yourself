Grid management
===============

## How it works

The hole diagram is in grid layout. You can put an element into the cell by position attribute into your element:

    box(position: 1,2)

As you see, to set an element into a cell, just type x and y parameters (x, y) where x is the column number and y is the row number.

Grid origin is (0, 0)
